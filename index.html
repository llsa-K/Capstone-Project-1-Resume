        <h2>Objective:</h2>       
        <p>I'm an aspiring BCA student with a growing passion for technology and a keen interest in front-end web development. Currently exploring  into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm building a solid foundation in creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces.
            Along with front-end skills, I've also learned the basics of programming and working with data through practical experience with the following
            Programming Languages such as C, C++, Java, Python. In Web Technologies, I've explored HTML (currently learning front-end development)  
            and in Databases, I'm experienced with Oracle SQL, Ms. Access. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving real-world problems through code, and continuously challenging myself to grow as a developer.</p>
